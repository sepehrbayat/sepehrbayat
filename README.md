## Quick snapshot
- Ship-ready engineer who can take ideas from zero to launch across the stack.
- Product-minded: crisp UX, measurable impact, and pragmatic architecture.
- Loves vibe-coding sessions, pairing, and leaving codebases cleaner than found.

## What I do best
- End-to-end web builds (React/Next.js/TypeScript + Node.js/Python).
- API design (REST/GraphQL), data modeling (PostgreSQL/Redis/ORMs), and observability.
- CI/CD, testing (Jest/Playwright), and performance tuning to keep teams fast.

## Current focus
- Building real-world apps in public with tight feedback loops.
- Modern DX: type-safety, linting, testing, preview environments, clear docs.
- Realtime features, AI-assisted flows, and thoughtful automation.

## How I work
- Small, frequent releases; spike → refine → harden.
- Pair/mob friendly; music on; logs/metrics always on.
- Code that reads like docs; PRs that are kind to reviewers.

## Toolbox
- Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite.
- Backend: Node.js (Express/Nest/Fastify), Python (FastAPI), GraphQL/REST.
- Data: PostgreSQL, Redis, Prisma/ORMs.
- Ops: Docker, CI/CD, cloud (AWS/Vercel), testing with Jest/Playwright.

## Open to
- Freelance/contract collaborations, open-source contributions, and rapid MVPs.
- Scaling products, improving developer experience, or just a good vibe-coding sprint.

Whoever lands here should feel both the polish and the energy—let's build something great. 🚀
